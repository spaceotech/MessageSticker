# iMessage Sticker App

As you know, with the release of iOS 10, Apple has now opened new doors for developers in the form of iMessage App feature. 

So, are you too excited to learn how to develop iMessage apps?

Yes?

Good! I’ve created a short tutorial with demo to show you the step-by-step process of developing basic iMessage sticker app.

Through this tutorial, you’ll be able to create a basic iMessage sticker app to send stickers to your contact list. However, you can develop even more interactive iMessage apps. We at Space-O Technologies have successfully launched our first iMessage sticker app. It was when I first learnt about developing iMessage apps. And, if you’ve any iMessage app idea and looking for an [iPhone app development company](https://www.spaceotechnologies.com/iphone-app-development/), you can contact Space-O Technologies for the same. Because not only we were the one the people who firstly stepped into iMessage development world, but we also have developed more than 2000+ mobile applications already.
